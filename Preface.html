     <h1>Preface</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the course on the C language. Before we start, let's see what
      we can use C for.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Machine Learning</li>
      <li>Application Writing</li>
      <li>Operating System Writing</li>
      <li>Manipulation of Computer Memory
        <ul>
          <li>This is something that's really useful. This is also something a lot of
            languages cannot do.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Basics for other languages
        <ul>
          <li>Here are some other languages that you can learn after this:
            <ul>
              <li>Python</li>
              <li>C++</li>
              <li>Java</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>
              <li>C#</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>There are other languages, but I didn't mention them because they are
            probably not good. The point is, C is, as Will Smith would say, the “Ground
            Zero”.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whenever you are tasked with writing a piece of code, try writing it down
      on a piece of paper before. Don't just read my code and follow along.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Don't copy-paste the code snippets in this course! I have specifically
        replaced certain characters with others. If you copy-paste the code, it
        will not compile!</p>
