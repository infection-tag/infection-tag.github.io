     <h1>1.1 Hello World</h1>

    <p>The first piece of code you should always write when learning a new language
      is called the “Hello, world” code. This code will do nothing but print
      out the phrase, ”Hello, world!" onto your screen.</p>
    <p>The first thing you need to do is open your command line (Windows) or
      Terminal (Mac/Linux). From there, type</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">$ mkdir c-learning
$ cd c-learning</code></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: Ignore the “$" symbol at the beginning of any line, it's just there
        to tell you that you are supposed to be typing this on your command line.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>mkdir made a new folder for your c code and executables. cd changes your
      directory from the default home one to the one you just made.</p>
    <p>Next, open the new file:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">$ vi helloworld.c</code></pre>
    <p>If you don't have vi installed, I suggest installing it. We will be using
      it for the majority of this course.</p>
    <p>Now, you should see a text editor on your screen. Vi is a text editor
      that is very bare-bones, and should come with your operating system. It
      works right out of your terminal.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: If you don't want vi running out of your terminal, check out gvim
        or macvim.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>From there, press i: This will put you into <i>insert mode</i>. Now you
      can add text.</p>
    <p>From there, enter this code in:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main() {
	printf("hello, world\n");
}</code></pre>
    <p>Now, you should hit the esc key, and type :wq. Adding the colon before
      makes it a command. wq tells the editor to write, then quit.</p>
    <p>Now you should see your terminal again. From there, type</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">$ clang helloworld.c
$ ./a.out</code></pre>
    <p>Assuming you have done everything correctly, you should see this on your
      screen:</p><pre><code class="language-text-plain">hello, world</code></pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: you may receive a warning on your screen after running clang. That's
        because the compiler (in this case, clang) noticed something out of the
        ordinary. However,&nbsp;</p>
