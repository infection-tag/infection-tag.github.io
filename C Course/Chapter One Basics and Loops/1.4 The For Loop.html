     <h1>1.4 The For Loop</h1>

    <p>Think of the for loop as a more bulky version of the while loop. Here
      is the generic for loop:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">for(set value; check; increment) {
	do something;
}</code></pre>
    <p>This may seem confusing, so let's put it into practice. Let's rewrite
      the squares.c code from earlier, this time with a for loop instead of a
      while loop.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* squares.c: version 2 */

main() {
	int i;
	for(i = 1; i &lt; 21; ++i)
		printf("%d\n", i^2);
}</code></pre>
    <p>Compare this code to the one in the previous section. Notice we cleaned
      up the code quite a bit: The following two lines have been removed and
      put into the condition of the for loop:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">i = 1;
i++;</code></pre>
    <p>Also, you'll notice I replaced the condition i ≤ 20 with i &lt; 21. This
      only works because i is going up by one; later you will learn that there
      are non-integer data types that we can increment by 0.5 at a time.</p>
    <p>Another thing you may have noticed with the for loop:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">for(i = 1; i &lt; 21; ++i)
		printf("%d\n", i^2);</code></pre>
    <p>I didn't include any curly braces! You may be thinking, "What a hypocrite!
      He told us that almost every bracket in C has a corresponding closing bracket!”
      First of all, I said almost. Second, I technically never put an opening
      curly brace; in fact, I don't need to! If a for loop is less than two lines
      (including the condition) you don't need curly braces. So, I can simplify
      the following expressions:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">for(i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
	printf("asd\n");
}

for(i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {}</code></pre>
    <p>into:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">for(i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
	printf("asd\n");

for(i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++);</code></pre>

      <p>Note: What do you think the second statement does? Why doesn't it have any body?&nbsp;</p>
