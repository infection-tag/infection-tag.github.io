     <h1>1.3 The While Loop</h1>

    <p>The while loop checks if something is true and does what it's supposed
      to. After it has done that, it checks again, and does the same thing.</p>
    <p>Here is the generic while loop:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">while(some condition is true) {
	do something;
}</code></pre>
    <p>Let's put this to the test with a program. Can you write a program that
      will print out the squares of all numbers from one to twenty? Probably
      not without manually printing all of them.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* squares.c: print all of the squares from one to twenty */

main() {
	int i;
	i = 1;
	while(i &lt;= 20) {
		printf("%d\n", i^2);
		i++;
	}
}</code></pre>
    <p>In this piece of code, there were several new things that we haven't introduced
      yet.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">/* squares.c: print all of the squares from one to twenty */</code></pre>
    <p>This is a <i>comment</i>. A comment exists so that you know what you are
      reading. Comments are contained between /* and */, and are ignored when
      the code is run.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">int i;
i = 1;</code></pre>
    <p>int is short for <i>integer</i>. In this case, we are creating an integer,
      called i. In the second line, we set i to be equal to 1.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">while(i &lt;= 20) {</code></pre>
    <p>the i ≤ 20 is the check; if it fails, it will “break” from the loop.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note: the “less-than-or-equal-to symbol” may render as one symbol on your
        screen, depending on what system you are using. However, the correct way
        to render it would be &lt;=, which looks like an arrow pointing to the
        left.</p>
    </blockquote><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">printf("%d\n", i^2);
i++;</code></pre>
    <p>We already know what “\n” means. What does %d mean? Well, it's a placeholder
      for an integer. Whenever we have a value that is bound to change, like
      with i in this code, we use a placeholder. Here are some other placeholders
      that can be used with printf:</p>
    <figure class="table">
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Placeholder</td>
            <td>Type</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>%d</td>
            <td>int</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>%c</td>
            <td>char</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>%s</td>
            <td>string</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>%f</td>
            <td>float</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>%l</td>
            <td>long</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </figure>

      <p>Note: don't fret if you don't know what these are; we'll cover them later
        on.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This time, unlike with our hello world code, there are two things inside
      the brackets. Well, what does the part after the comma mean? Well, like
      I said, %d is a placeholder for an integer. So, naturally, it follows,
      that the next thing will be the integer that should replace the %d. We
      already know what i is, but what does the ^2 mean? i^2 can be read as <i>i to the power of two</i>,
      or <i>i squared</i>.</p>
    <p>After that, we incremented i, to become one more that its earlier value.
      i++ tells the operator to read the value of i and then increment; ++i will
      increment the value of i and then read it. In this instance, the two are
      interchangable, but when we move on to more advanced concepts, the order
      will become essential to the success of the code.</p>

        Try it.</p>
