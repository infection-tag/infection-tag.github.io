     <h1>1.2 Hello World: Breakdown</h1>

    <p>Let's do a further analysis of helloworld.c:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main() {
	printf("hello, world\n");
}</code></pre>
    <p>This is the most basic code you can write, but it actually teaches us
      a lot.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>#include imports a header library, in this case, stdio.h. stdio.h and
      any other header files include functions, which, for our purpose, are basically
      just tools you can use for different things.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">main() {</code></pre>
    <p>This is the main function. As was stated earlier, this is the main tool.
      This is the implementation, or the code behind the tool.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">	printf("hello, world\n");</code></pre>
    <p>printf is another tool who's purpose is to print what is contained in
      the quotes on screen. the “\n” at the end is the symbol for <i>newline</i>,
      which is similar to typing an <i>enter </i>or <i>return </i>key. The semicolon
      at the end is there to tell the parser that the line is over. While adding
      semicolons may seem like more of a downside, like many things in C, it
      will make a lot more sense later on.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Try removing the \n from the end of the file and recompile it. Can you
        guess what will happen?</p>
    </blockquote><pre><code class="language-text-x-csrc">}</code></pre>
    <p>All this line does is close the implementation of the main function. Whenever
      you open a bracket in C, you will almost always need to close it.</p>
